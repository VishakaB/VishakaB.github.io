      title="Continuous and Responsive D2D Victim Localization for Post-Disaster Emergencies"
      img="/emergencyservice.jpg"
      desc="One of the most challenging tasks in a disaster scenario is the detection and localization of victims with high accuracy and minimum delay, especially in out-of-coverage areas. In the event of a disaster that disrupts the cellular network infrastructure, emergency calls can be relayed to the core network via multi-hop D2D communications. In this paper, a localization system is proposed that uses radio measurements obtained through such D2D multi-hop assisted emergency calls to localize in-coverage and out-of-coverage devices. To address the uncertainty and gradual reception of data in real-time in this scenario, a dynamic constraint satisfaction-based Multi Victim Localization Algorithm (MVLA) is proposed. This algorithm locates multi-hop devices in a progressive propagation manner to provide fast and accurate updates on victim locations. Additionally, three modes of MVLA, namely MVLA_recent, MVLA_seq, and MVLA_all are proposed. Simulation results demonstrate that MVLA_all has a lower localization error compared to MVLA_recent and MVLA_seq. Moreover, MVLA_all is compared with an existing particle filtering-based localization algorithm called RSSI Monte-Carlo Boxed Localization (RSSI-MCL) under an increasing number of emergency user devices and functional gNodeBs. Results show that MVLA_all significantly outperforms the RSSI-MCL method in terms of localization accuracy and computational delay."

      title="M-Ary QAM Asynchronous-NOMA D2D Network With Cyclic Triangular-SIC Decoding Scheme Published in: IEEE Access (Volume: 11)"
      img="/mary.jpg"
      desc="The complexity of successive interference cancellation at the receiver’s end is a challenging issue in conventional non-orthogonal multiple access assisted massive wireless networks. The computational complexity of decoding increases exponentially with the number of users. Further, under realistic channel conditions, a synchronous non-orthogonal multiple access scheme is impractical in the uplink device-to-device communications. In this paper, an asynchronous non-orthogonal multiple access-based cyclic triangular successive interference cancellation scheme is proposed for a massive device-to-device network. The proposed scheme reduces the decoding complexity, energy consumption, and bit error rate of a superimposed signal received in an outband device-to-device network. More specifically, the scheme follows three consecutive stages; optimization, decoding, and re-transmission. In the optimization stage, a dual Lagrangian objective function is defined to maximize the number of data symbols decoded at the receiver by determining an optimal interference cancellation triangle, under the co-channel interference and data rate constraints. In the decoding stage, the data in the optimal interference cancellation triangle is decoded using a conventional triangular successive interference cancellation technique. Next, the remaining users’ data are decoded in sequential iterations of the proposed scheme, using the retransmissions from such users. Utilizing the successive interference cancellation characteristics, the performance of the proposed device-to-device network is defined in terms of energy efficiency, bit error rate, computational complexity, and decoding delay metrics. Moreover, the performance of the proposed decoding scheme is compared with the conventional triangular successive interference cancellation decoding scheme to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed scheme."

    title="Adaptive Emergency Call Service for Disaster Management"
    img="/mary.jpg"
    desc="Reliable and efficient transmission of emergency
calls during a massive network failure is both an indispensable and challenging task. In this paper, we propose a
novel fully 3GPP and 5G compatible emergency call protocol named 5G StandalOne Service (5G-SOS). A 5G-SOSenabled
emergency service provides potential out-of-coverage victims’ devices with a way to contact the 4G/5G
core network through D2D multi-hop relaying protocol. The objective of 5G-SOS is to maintain this connection
even when a large fraction of the network infrastructure is destroyed. 5G-SOS is a fully distributed protocol
designed to generate zero additional control traffic and to adapt its parameters based on the local emergency call
congestion. Therefore, devices behave as an ad-hoc network with the common purpose to ensure the best
chances for emergency call transfer within a reasonable delay. A densely populated Traverse city of Michigan,
USA, with a 15,000 population, is used to evaluate 5G-SOS under extreme emergency scenarios. The performance
of 5G-SOS is shown to be significant when compared with existing protocols, namely, M-HELP and FINDER, in
terms of transmission success rate, end-to-end latency, network traffic control, and energy management. 5G-SOS
provides satisfactory performance (success rate of 50%) even when the number of simultaneous emergency calls
is very high (5000 calls over 10 min). On average, 5G-SOS performs 24.9% better than M-HELP and 73.9% than
FINDER in terms of success rate. Additionally, 5G-SOS reduces the average end-end latency of the emergency
calls transfer by 20.8% compared to M-HELP and 61.7% compared to FINDER.."
