    title="Continuous and Responsive D2D Victim Localization for Post-Disaster Emergencies"
    img="/post_img.webp"
    desc="One of the most challenging tasks in a disaster scenario is the detection and localization of victims with high
accuracy and minimum delay, especially in out-of-coverage areas. In the event of a disaster that disrupts the
cellular network infrastructure, emergency calls can be relayed to the core network via multi-hop D2D
communications. In this paper, a localization system is proposed that uses radio measurements obtained
through such D2D multi-hop assisted emergency calls to localize in-coverage and out-of-coverage devices. To
address the uncertainty and gradual reception of data in real-time in this scenario, a dynamic constraint
satisfaction-based Multi Victim Localization Algorithm (MVLA) is proposed. This algorithm locates multi-hop
devices in a progressive propagation manner to provide fast and accurate updates on victim locations.
Additionally, three modes of MVLA, namely MVLA_recent, MVLA_seq, and MVLA_all are proposed. Simulation
results demonstrate that MVLA_all has a lower localization error compared to MVLA_recent and MVLA_seq.
Moreover, MVLA_all, is compared with an existing particle filtering-based localization algorithm called RSSI Monte-
Carlo Boxed Localization (RSSI-MCL) under an increasing number of emergency user devices and functional
gNodeBs. Results show that
MVLA_all significantly outperforms the RSSI-MCL method in terms of localization accuracy and computational
delay."
