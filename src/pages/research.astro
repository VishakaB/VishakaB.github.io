      title="M-HELP - Multi-Hop Emergency Call Protocol in 5G"
      img="/mary.jpg"
      desc="Wireless mobile networks are widely used during large catastrophes such as earthquakes and floods where robust networking systems are indispensable to protect human lives. The objective of this paper is to present a self-adaptive emergency call protocol that allows keeping potential victims connected to the core network through the available functional stations, called gNBs in 5G, when a fraction of gNBs in a network area are fully destructed with no access to other gNBs or the core network due to the disaster. Nowadays, the density of mobile devices and progress in outband device to device (D2D) communication provide the framework for the extension of both mobile and network coverage. We propose a novel, 3GPP compatible and completely distributed protocol called M-HELP for emergency call service for 4G/5G enabled mobile networks. We assess M-HELP efficiency under various scenarios representing different degrees of network destruction and different emergency call conditions. The tests demonstrate the significant performance of M-HELP in terms of transmission success rate, energy management, latency and control traffic load."

      title="A New Green Prospective of Non-orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) for 5G"
      img="/mary.jpg"
      desc="Energy efficiency is a major concern in the emerging mobile cellular wireless networks since massive connectivity is to be expected with high energy requirements from the network operators. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) being the frontier multiple access scheme for 5G, there exists numerous research attempts on enhancing the energy efficiency of NOMA enabled wireless networks while maintaining its outstanding performance metrics such as high throughput, data rates and capacity maximized optimally. The concept of green NOMA is introduced in a generalized manner to identify the energy efficient NOMA schemes. These schemes will result in an optimal scenario in which the energy generated for communication is managed sustainably. Hence, the effect on the environment, economy, living beings, etc is minimized. The recent research developments are classified for a better understanding of areas which are lacking attention and needs further improvement. Also, the performance comparison of energy efficient, NOMA schemes against conventional NOMA is presented. Finally, challenges and emerging research trends, for energy efficient NOMA are discussed."

    title="Optimization of Secure Emergency Call Services in Asynchronous-NOMA D2D Network"
    img="/mary.jpg"
    desc="This paper investigates the issue of improving secrecy capacity of device-to-device (D2D) communications in disaster scenarios under the presence of jammers in close proximity. Furthermore, an asynchronous-non orthogonal multiple access (A-NOMA) assisted transmission scheme is considered due to the resource limitations and the asynchrony in signal receptions in out-of-coverage D2D scenarios. A binary optimization problem is proposed to select the optimal data which enhances the sum secrecy capacity of the transmissions. The results show that the proposed optimized scheme outperforms the conventional secrecy capacity."
